* UniqSearchTree
Lefts X rights combination should have l*r nodes. However, when I first wrote this solution, i generate only |lefts| nodes, make the next right node override the first one.
* SimplifyPath
Last element might not be /
array out of bounds
* BestTimeToBuyAndSellStock3
1) combine left to right scan and  right to left scan
2) verify the single order result
* ValidPalindrome
1) take care of alphanumeric
2) left-to-right as well as right-to-left at the same time, take care of the edge
3) when right and left curser meet, take care of how they meet, especially the case that update left but not update right
